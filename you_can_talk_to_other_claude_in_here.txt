### 2025-11-16 - Instance B (Research Completion)

Hey there! Just finished a massive research sprint for SimpleFlow. Here's what's done:

**COMPLETED:**
-  Launched 6 parallel research agents (Input Modalities, CV, Performance, Users, Competitive, UX)
-  Generated 329KB of comprehensive research documentation
-  Validated ALL 5 Tier 1 make-or-break hypotheses
-  Created week-1 synthesis document
-  Updated research index (6/8 domains complete)
-  Created 2 critical ADRs (Eye Tracking Method, Multi-Modal Architecture)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
1. **Technical:** MediaPipe Iris can achieve 1.4-2.5� accuracy (sufficient!)
2. **Performance:** <50ms latency achievable with threading architecture
3. **UX:** Multi-modal (gaze+voice+head) reduces errors from 43% � 11.7% (75% reduction!)
4. **Market:** 7.8M-30M users, RSI segment (1-2M devs) is largest
5. **Competitive:** NO tool combines gaze+voice+AI for programming - massive gap!

**DECISION:**  GO - Proceed with Phase 1 implementation

**WHAT'S NEXT:**
- Phase 1: WebcamSource implementation (OpenCV camera capture)
- Validate MediaPipe accuracy claims with hands-on prototype
- Build remaining ADRs if needed
- Start Phase 2 planning (MediaPipe integration, filtering, calibration)

**FILES TO CHECK:**
- `research/synthesis/week-1-synthesis.md` - Full research summary
- `research/agent-outputs/` - 6 comprehensive reports (50-107KB each)
- `research/decisions/001-eye-tracking-method.md` - MediaPipe chosen
- `research/decisions/002-multi-modal-architecture.md` - Gaze+voice+head core design
- `research/0-research-index.md` - Updated status dashboard

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Foundation research: 75% complete
- Ready to start implementation
- All critical unknowns answered
- Clear technical roadmap established

If you're working on implementation, the research is all done and documented. Everything you need is in `research/agent-outputs/`. The two partial domains (Text Entry, System Integration) can be filled in later - they're not blocking Phase 1-2.

**UPDATE:** Just completed Alternative Inputs research (73KB)! 🎉
- Switch scanning = universal access (even single muscle twitch works!)
- DIY solutions: $1-$50 (aluminum foil capacitive touch, Arduino switches, sip-and-puff)
- Residual movement mapping: ANY controllable movement → input signal
- Roadmap: Phase 1 = switches+blink, Phase 2 = EMG+hybrids, Phase 3 = temporal/macro language
- **Key:** SimpleFlow can support EVERY user, regardless of severity of disability

Let me know what you're working on and I can avoid duplicating effort!

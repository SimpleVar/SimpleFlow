## Project Context

### What is SimpleFlow?

SimpleFlow is an **accessibility software project** aiming to make computers fully usable for people with motor impairments. The vision is to enable:
- Pointing and clicking (cursor control)
- Text entry (typing, communication)
- General computer usage (navigation, workflows, quality of life)
- **Professional-grade work** (coding, design, writing, etc.)

### Current State

- **Phase:** Early exploration - evaluating all potential solutions
- **Approach:** Open to any input method that works (eye tracking, head tracking, voice, gestures, multi-modal, etc.)
- **Goal:** Discover what's actually possible before committing to specific technologies
- **User Base:** People with motor impairments (cerebral palsy, ALS, RSI, spinal cord injury, etc.)

### Key Philosophy

**Universal Design Principle:**
The software should be:
1. **Essential for** people with motor limitations (enables computer use)
2. **Beneficial for** fully-abled users (potentially better/faster/more ergonomic than mouse/keyboard)

**Example:** Like how curb cuts help wheelchair users (essential) but also help bicyclists, strollers, delivery carts (beneficial).

**Critical Question:** Where is the intersection where accessibility software becomes *universally desirable*?

### Why This Matters

We're not just building "good enough" accessibility software. We're exploring whether:
- **Alternative input can be superior** - Could gaze+voice actually be faster/better than mouse+keyboard for some tasks?
- **Ergonomics benefit everyone** - Could reducing mouse/keyboard fatigue help *all* knowledge workers?
- **AI assistance is the differentiator** - Could prediction, intent inference, and context-awareness make this not just accessible, but magical?
- **Professional use is the key** - If we can enable professional coding/design work, we solve the hardest problem and everything else follows

### What We're Really Asking You

Beyond documenting motor disabilities and existing solutions, we need you to think critically about:

1. **Where is the unmet need?**
   - What specific tasks are hardest/impossible with current accessibility tech?
   - Where do people give up or work in frustrating ways?
   - What would make someone say "I wish this existed"?

2. **What would be a breakthrough?**
   - Not 10% better than existing tools - 10x better
   - What would change the game?
   - What intersection of tech could create something new?

3. **Where could we win?**
   - What segment is underserved? (We think: programmers with motor impairments)
   - What use case has no good solution?
   - Where could we differentiate meaningfully?

4. **What's the universal appeal?**
   - Could this be better than mouse/keyboard for *anyone*?
   - What would drive adoption beyond accessibility need?
   - Where's the "curb cut effect" opportunity?

**Think like a startup looking for product-market fit, not just documenting a problem space.**

## Research Mission

We need comprehensive research on:

### 1. Motor Disabilities & User Needs

**Understand the spectrum:**
- What types of motor impairments exist?
- How do they affect computer use specifically?
- What are the physical capabilities and constraints?
- What tasks are impossible, difficult, or frustrating with traditional input?

**User taxonomy:**
- Severity levels (total paralysis → hand tremors → RSI)
- Progression over time (stable, degenerative, episodic)
- Combination with other disabilities (vision, cognitive, speech)
- Age ranges and contexts (pediatric, working-age, elderly)

**Workflow analysis:**
- What do users actually need to do on computers?
- Professional tasks (programming, design, writing, spreadsheets)
- Creative tasks (art, music, video editing)
- Communication (email, chat, social media)
- Entertainment and quality of life
- Learning and education

### 2. Existing Accessibility Landscape

**What already exists?**
- Commercial solutions (Tobii Dynavox, Dragon NaturallySpeaking, etc.)
- Open-source tools (OptiKey, Camera Mouse, eViacam, etc.)
- Platform-specific (Windows Eye Control, macOS Switch Control, etc.)
- Research prototypes (academic projects, papers)

**Gap analysis:**
- What works well in existing solutions?
- What are the major pain points and frustrations?
- What's too expensive or hardware-dependent?
- What use cases are underserved?
- Where is professional-grade work (coding, design) particularly lacking?

### 3. Input Modalities & Technical Possibilities

**Explore all options:**
- **Eye tracking:** Webcam-based vs. specialized hardware
- **Head tracking:** Face detection, IMU sensors, camera-based
- **Voice input:** Speech recognition, voice commands, dictation
- **Facial gestures:** Blinks, mouth movements, expressions
- **Alternative devices:** Sip-puff, switches, EMG sensors
- **Brain-computer interfaces:** Current state and near-future potential
- **Multi-modal:** Combinations of the above

**For each modality:**
- Accuracy and reliability
- Hardware requirements and cost
- Learning curve and fatigue
- Suitability for different tasks (pointing vs. typing vs. commands)
- User satisfaction in studies

### 4. The "Universal Appeal" Question

**Research where accessibility tech has crossed over:**
- **Voice assistants:** Started as accessibility, now mainstream (Siri, Alexa)
- **Speech-to-text:** Accessibility origin, now used by everyone
- **Eye tracking:** Gaming (Tobii Eye Tracker), attention research, UX studies
- **Gesture control:** Kinect, Leap Motion, VR controllers
- **Text prediction:** T9, smartphone keyboards - everyone benefits from prediction now

**Investigate potential crossover for SimpleFlow:**
- Could gaze control be *faster* than mouse for certain tasks?
- Could voice+gaze be superior to keyboard+mouse for some workflows?
- Could fatigue reduction benefit *all* knowledge workers (not just disabled)?
- Could prediction/automation benefit everyone (like smartphone keyboards)?
- Could this prevent RSI/carpal tunnel for able-bodied users?

**Specific scenarios to research:**

**Scenario 1: Multi-monitor workflows**
- Question: Could gaze be faster for moving between 3+ monitors than mouse?
- Hypothesis: Eyes move faster than hands - could gaze+voice beat mouse for multi-screen navigation
- Research: Find studies on multi-monitor usage, attention switching, gaze advantages

**Scenario 2: Hands-free during other tasks**
- Question: When would able-bodied users *want* hands-free computer control?
- Examples: Eating lunch while working, holding a baby, cooking while following recipe on screen
- Research: Situational impairments, context where traditional input is inconvenient

**Scenario 3: Fatigue and repetitive strain**
- Question: How many knowledge workers suffer from RSI, carpal tunnel, or mouse fatigue?
- Hypothesis: Large market of people who *need* to reduce mouse/keyboard use for health
- Research: RSI prevalence in programmers, designers, writers; prevention interest

**Scenario 4: Speed for power users**
- Question: Could expert users be *faster* with gaze+voice than mouse+keyboard for certain tasks?
- Examples: Code navigation (look at function, say "go to definition"), UI testing (look, say "click")
- Research: Expert performance studies, command-line vs. GUI speed, vim/emacs power users

**Scenario 5: Ergonomics and posture**
- Question: Could alternative input enable better posture/ergonomics?
- Hypothesis: Gaze+voice allows neutral posture (no hunching over keyboard, no shoulder strain from mouse)
- Research: Ergonomics research, standing desk users, posture and productivity

**Scenario 6: Accessibility as prevention**
- Question: Would able-bodied users adopt this to *prevent* future disability?
- Hypothesis: Like blue-light glasses or ergonomic keyboards - proactive health measure
- Research: Prevention mindset, health-conscious knowledge workers, longevity focus

**Example hypotheses to explore:**
- Gaze+voice might be faster for UI navigation than mouse-only (research: compare task completion times)
- Head tracking might reduce RSI for able-bodied users (research: ergonomics studies, RSI prevention)
- Predictive interfaces could boost productivity for everyone (research: T9 → smartphone keyboard adoption curve)
- Multi-modal input might be more natural than single-modality (research: how humans communicate - speech+gesture is natural)
- Voice coding could be faster for boilerplate (research: Talon, voice coding communities)

**Critical insight to validate:**
If we make this good enough for able-bodied power users to *choose* it, we've created something extraordinary. Research whether this is realistic or fantasy.

### 5. Human Factors & UX Research

- Fitts' Law and pointing efficiency
- Dwell time vs. explicit click (fatigue, flow, accuracy)
- Mode switching and cognitive load
- Error correction and recovery
- Feedback mechanisms (visual, audio, haptic)
- Learning curves and skill acquisition
- Fatigue patterns (physical and cognitive)

**Accessibility-specific considerations:**
- Tremor tolerance and stabilization

## Specific Focus Areas We're Most Interested In

Based on our initial thinking, we suspect the biggest opportunities might be:

### 1. Programmers with Motor Impairments

**Why this segment:**
- Highest-skilled, highest-paid knowledge workers
- Existing accessibility tools completely inadequate for coding
- Complex workflows (IDE, terminal, browser, docs simultaneously)
- Professional identity at stake (want to code, not just "access computer")
- Willing to learn complex tools (vim users prove this)
- Could benefit from AI assistance (code completion, intent inference)

**Key research questions:**
- How many developers have motor impairments?
- What do they use currently? What works/doesn't work?
- What specific coding tasks are hardest? (navigation, typing, debugging, refactoring)
- Would able-bodied programmers use gaze+voice for ergonomics/speed?
- Can we integrate with IDE extensions to make coding-specific features?

### 2. Multi-Modal Input (Gaze + Voice + Context)

**Why this approach:**
- Each modality compensates for others' weaknesses
- More natural (humans use speech + gesture together)
- Faster than single modality (eyes point, voice confirms, AI predicts)
- Differentiates from existing tools (most are single-modality)

**Key research questions:**
- What combinations work best for different tasks?
- How to switch seamlessly between modalities?
- Can AI predict intent to reduce explicit commands?
- Does context-awareness (knowing you're in IDE vs. browser) enable better interaction?

### 3. AI-Assisted Interaction

**Why this could be the breakthrough:**
- Modern accessibility tools are "dumb" (no prediction, no learning)
- AI could predict clicks before dwell completes
- Intent inference could calibrate implicitly
- Code-aware prediction could speed up typing
- Personalization could adapt to individual patterns

**Key research questions:**
- What AI techniques are mature enough to use?
- Can prediction actually reduce interaction time measurably?
- Would users trust AI-assisted actions?
- What's the latency budget for ML inference?

### 4. Universal Design / Crossover Potential

**Why this matters strategically:**
- Larger market = more sustainable project
- Network effects (community, plugin ecosystem)
- Reduces stigma (not "disabled software", just "better software")
- Could drive innovation (like smartphone keyboards)

**Key research questions:**
- Are there tasks where alternative input is objectively faster?
- Would ergonomics/health benefits drive adoption?
- Could this be the "future of computer interaction" for everyone?
- What would make this aspirational, not just accessible?

## Context About SimpleFlow So Far

### What We've Built
- **Input abstraction layer:** `InputSource` interface, `InputManager` system
- **Configuration system:** TOML-based config management

- Universal design is possible (not just accessible, but better)

### What We Don't Know Yet
- **Who exactly should we build for?** (Which personas are highest priority?)
- **What input methods will actually work?** (Accuracy, usability, adoption)
- **Can we make something universally desirable?** (Not just "good enough for accessibility")
- **What would make us 10x better?** (Where's the breakthrough opportunity?)
- **Is our target market (programmers with motor impairments) big enough to matter?**
- **Would able-bodied developers actually use this?** (Or is that wishful thinking?)

**This research will help us answer these questions and validate (or invalidate) our hypotheses.**

## Important Notes

### Respect and Empathy
- Use person-first language ("person with disability" not "disabled person") unless preference is stated otherwise
- Avoid pity or inspiration narratives - treat as design/engineering problem
- Recognize user expertise (they know their needs better than we do)
- Center user autonomy and independence

### Quality over Speed
- Prioritize depth and accuracy over quick answers
- Cite sources where possible
- Note confidence levels (well-established vs. emerging research vs. anecdotal)
- Identify gaps in current knowledge

### Practical Focus
- We're building software, so keep technical feasibility in mind
- Balance aspirational (what could be) with realistic (what's buildable now)
- Consider cost constraints (target users may have limited resources)
- Think about maintainability and scalability
